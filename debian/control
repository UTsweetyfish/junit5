Description: JUnit regression test framework for Java
 JUnit is a framework to write repeatable tests.
 .
 Unlike previous versions of JUnit, JUnit 5 is composed of several different
 modules from three sub-projects: JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter and
 JUnit Vintage.
 .
 The JUnit Platform serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks
 on the JVM. It also defines the TestEngine API for developing a testing
 framework that runs on the platform. Furthermore, the platform provides
 a Console Launcher to launch the platform from the command line and a JUnit 4
 based Runner for running any TestEngine on the platform in a JUnit 4 based
 environment. First-class support for the JUnit Platform also exists in popular
 IDEs and build tools.
 .
 JUnit Jupiter is the combination of the new programming model and extension
 model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. The Jupiter sub-project
 provides a TestEngine for running Jupiter based tests on the platform.
 .
 JUnit Vintage provides a TestEngine for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based
 tests on the platform.
